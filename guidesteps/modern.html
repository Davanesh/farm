    Modern farming integrates advanced tools and techniques to boost efficiency, reduce costs, and ensure sustainable growth. This section introduces farmers to innovative practices.

   1. Drip Irrigation:

A water-saving technique where water drips slowly to plant roots, either on the soil surface or directly into the root zone.
The guide explains the setup process, cost, and how this method reduces water wastage and enhances nutrient absorption.
 
2.Organic Farming:

Focuses on natural farming techniques that eliminate chemical fertilizers and pesticides.
Covers the preparation of biofertilizers, vermicompost, and pest repellents like neem oil.

3.Crop Rotation & Intercropping:

Educates farmers on growing different crops in succession (crop rotation) to prevent nutrient depletion.
Highlights intercropping (e.g., planting legumes alongside cereals) to utilize land efficiently and suppress pests.

4.Precision Farming Tools:

Introduces technology like GPS-based farm mapping, drones for pest monitoring, and soil sensors for real-time data collection.
Helps farmers optimize resource use and identify crop issues early.
