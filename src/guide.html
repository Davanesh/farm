            <div id="guideMoreContent" class="hidden-content">
                <p><br>
                    Planting is the first and most critical step in agriculture, and success depends on accurate methods and timing. This section ensures that farmers understand every aspect of planting for their crops, from soil preparation to nurturing seedlings.
                    <br><br>
                    1. Crop-Specific Tips:
                    <br>
                    Each crop requires unique care for optimal growth. For instance:
                    Paddy: Needs waterlogged fields, proper spacing between seedlings, and specific planting times based on seasonal rainfall.
                    Sugarcane: Requires deep plowing, furrow planting, and the use of seed sets with at least three buds for better sprouting.
                    Turmeric: Prefers well-drained soil with rhizome planting and high organic matter.
                    The guide provides actionable steps to achieve a high yield for each crop.
                    <br><br>
                    2.Seed Selection:
                    <br>
                    Emphasizes the importance of choosing certified, high-quality seeds that are resistant to diseases and pests.
                    Tips include checking germination rates, ensuring proper storage conditions, and contacting reliable suppliers.
                    <br><br>
                    3.Soil Preparation:
                    <br>
                    Guides farmers on testing their soil for nutrients like nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium.
                    Includes techniques for adding organic manures, green manures, and micronutrient-rich fertilizers to enhance soil fertility.
                    <br><br>
                    4.Seasonal Planting Advice:
                    <br>
                    Tamil Nadu has distinct seasons, and each impacts farming differently. For example:
                    During the Kharif season, farmers should prioritize rain-fed crops like paddy and millets.
                    In the Rabi season, farmers can grow pulses and wheat with limited irrigation.
                    The guide aligns planting schedules with these seasonal patterns for maximum productivity.
